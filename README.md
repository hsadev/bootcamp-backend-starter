HSA Final Project - BACKEND Description

1. artists database: contains artist ID and name (we can add more information after API implementation)

2. matches: contains user IDs matched to one another (currently, there is only 1 match per user, and most matches are not injective yet)

3. relations: contains a user ID and the song ID that the user likes (currently, there are some redundancies due to the random generator)

4. songs: contains song ID and song information and refers to the artist object

5. users: contains user ID and some basic user information
